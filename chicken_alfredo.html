                <h4>For the Chicken</h4>

                <li>1 pound of boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon of pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>

                <li>½ cup of butter, cut into large cubes or slices</li>
                <li>2 cups of heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon of Italian Seasoning</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon of salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon of pepper</li>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente according to package directions, usually 10 minutes. Reserve ½ cup of the cooking water, then drain well.</li>
                <li>Season chicken breasts with the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Once it's shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute. Add the chicken and leave it for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. Flip and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, picking up the pan to give it a gentle swirl. Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into ½-inch-thick slices. Tent with foil while you prepare the sauce.</li>
                <li>In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter and cream; whisk until butter has melted.</li>
                <li>Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and smooth.</li>
                <li>Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken.</li>
                <li>Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth. (If the sauce ends up too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.)</li>
                <li>Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettuccine noodles.</li>
                <li>Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
